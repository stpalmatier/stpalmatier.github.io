<h1><strong>Rockport, Massachusetts<strong></h1>
<p><h6>Located at the tip of the Cape Ann peninsula, Rockport was originally settled 
as Sandy Bay in the 1690s. The small settlement, which had previously been a source 
of timber, by the early nineteenth century began quarrying operations and became known
as a granite exporter on the east coast.</h6></p>
