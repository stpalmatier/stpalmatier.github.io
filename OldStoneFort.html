<p><h6>The marker on the building currently on the site reads: ‘Site of fort erected 
by public subscription as a protection against British warships during the War of 1812,
captured in a sneak attack and dismantled by frigate Nymphe. Ammunition gone, all nine 
seafencibles taken prisoner, the townsmen hurled rocks, using their stockings as slings.”</h6></p>
