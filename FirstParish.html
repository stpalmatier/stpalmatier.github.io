<p><h6>The “Old First Parish Burying Ground” in Rockport, Massachusetts was actually 
the burying ground for the fifth parish of Gloucester, which until 1840 was called 
Sandy Bay. Previously the land that the burying ground sits on had belonged to the 
Tarr family, the first residents of Sandy Bay. John Tarr donated the land to the parish 
upon his death in 1732, and is buried there.  His house, dated as having been built in 1720,
sits atop the hill overlooking the ocean on Mill Street directly behind the cemetery. The Tarr
property sat next to the Pool family’s plot, which would become the Mill Pond, and mills.</h6></p>
