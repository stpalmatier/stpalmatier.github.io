<p><h6>When quarrying ended here in 1929, rain, run-off, and springs on the quarry floor quickly filled the pit with water. Until the mid-19th century, quarrymen kept their working area dry by removing water by hand, a bucket at a time, or by harnessing a team of oxen to a winch. Some quarries installed wind-powered pumps, but by the 1860s,
most used steam engines, running day and night, to remove water. At its deepest point, 
the Babson Farm quarry is about 60 feet deep.</h6></p>
