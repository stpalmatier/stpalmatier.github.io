<p><h6>John Pool, the second permanent European settler in Sandy Bay in 1700, acquired rights</h6></p>
<p>to build a gristmill in 1702. He created the Mill Pond to order to supply power to the mill. He</p>
<p>also went on to build a lumber mill on the site, which cut large hemlock timbers subsequently</p>
<p>sent to Boston to build Long Wharf. The photo shows the remains of the ice house used to</p>
<p>harvest ice from the pond, another Rockport export.</p>
