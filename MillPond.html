<p><h6>John Pool, the second permanent European settler in Sandy Bay in 1700, acquired rights
to build a gristmill in 1702. He created the Mill Pond to order to supply power to the mill. He
also went on to build a lumber mill on the site, which cut large hemlock timbers subsequently
sent to Boston to build Long Wharf. The photo shows the remains of the ice house used to
harvest ice from the pond, another Rockport export.</h6></p>
